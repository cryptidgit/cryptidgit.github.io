	<p>Hi, I'm Ryan. I'm a graduate of Capitol Technology University with
		a B.S. in Computer Science. I like programming and I love learning
		things, from sewing to cooking to disaster prep. This website will
		serve as a central collection for projects that I've worked on as well
		as a cool personal space for whatever I want. Thanks for visiting
		and have fun :)</p>
